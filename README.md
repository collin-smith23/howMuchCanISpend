# howMuchCanISpend

How Much Can I Spend is an application of simplicity. Trying to manage time is tricky enough without thinking of the expenses. 
I simply want to create an application that makes thinking of lifes next step a little bit easier. A friendly user interface should
allow us to view future expenses for vacations while taking in consideration how many paychecks we will receive before then. My goal 
when creating this is to have an application that paints a picture of how much you need to set aside and how much you can without you having to think.
